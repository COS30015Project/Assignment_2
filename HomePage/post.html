                        <p>Welcome to our data visualisation project, which explores the fascinating and diverse landscape of Asian migration to the United States. Over the past years, the United States has witnessed a significant influx of immigrants from various Asian countries, contributing to the nation's cultural, social, and economic fabric. Through the lens of data visualisation, we aim to unveil the intricate patterns and trends in Asian migration, shedding light on the motivations, destinations, and experiences of these individuals and their impact on American society.</p>
                        <p>Using four data visualisations is an effective way to showcase a project's key insights. By employing a variety of visual formats, such as heat map, line graph, bar chart, and pie chart, we can present data from different point of view for different factors.</p>
                        <p>The reason we decide on using a heat map, line graph, bar chart and pie chart is because the heat map can reveal patterns, the line graph can demonstrate changes over time, bar chart can show comparisons and pie charts offer a quick overview of data we would like to present.</p>
                        <p>Join us as we delve into the rich tapestry of Asian immigration, using charts and graphs to create a compelling narrative that showcases the dynamic and evolving nature of the Asian American experience in the United States.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Heat Map: Population</h2>
                        <a href="https://cos30045ass2.netlify.app/heat_map/heatmap"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/HeatMap.jpg" alt="..." /></a>

                        <p>The heat map showned above is to present the population of Asians migrate to USA. We used different colours in the heat map to indicate different states in the USA. By hovering over each state of our heat map, the total number of Asians will appear on that states. Each state is clickable, by clicking on a state, it will zoom in and and show us the specific number of each Asian race in that state.There is a slider as well which is to show us different population data on different years.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Line Graph: Currency</h2>
                        <a href="https://cos30045ass2.netlify.app/line_chart/linechart"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/LineChart.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <p>The line graph shows our first factor of Asians migrate to the USA. This is to present the currency of Asians countries compared to USA. On the X-Axis we have the years and on the Y-Axis we have the currency value. A variety of colours were used for each of the lines in the line graph. This to help us indicate different countries currentcy rate compared with the USA. When hovered over the dots on the line graph, we are able to show the details such as country, year and value. There is also a drop down list for the line graph to show the specific Asian country currency.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Bar Chart: Education</h2>
                        <a href="https://cos30045ass2.netlify.app/bar_chart/barchart"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/BarChart.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <p>The bar chart above shows our next factor of Asians migrate to the USA. The number of Asians migrate to USA for their education in order to be able to get hired in the USA with higher pay and better working environment. There are 3 different buttons for our bar chart. The total button will show the total number of Asians migrated to USA from their country. The male button will show the number of males migrated from their country and the female button will show the number of females migrated from their country. The details can be displayed when we hover over the bars in the bar chart.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Pie Chart: Promotion</h2>
                        <a href="https://cos30045ass2.netlify.app/pie_chart/piechart"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/PieChart.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <p>The pie chart above shows our last factor of Asians migrate to the USA. The number of Asians worker from different Asian countries in their company getting promoted to work in the USA. Each colour in the pie chart indicates different Asian countries. By hovering over the pie chart, the total count of each Asian race will show in numbers. The percentage out of 100% for the pie chart will also appear for each country stated in the pie chart.</p>
